# This is our CS 546 Web Programming I Final Project: MyGarage
Our application works with the motive of managing car maintenance, allowing users to find service centers based on service offered and ratings. Regular users are able to use our application to find the service centers that fit their needs, while service center owners are able to advertise and manage the services that they offer.

## How to Setup
Run 'npm install' to install the required dependencies for our project.  
Then run 'npm run seed' to run the task of seeding the database.

## How the Application Works
- Upon running 'npm start' website with load on 'http://localhost:3000/', the first page will be the landing page.
- A user can click on the site name in the header to return to the homepage at any time.
- A user can otherwise use the sidebar on the left side of the page to navigate between most pages.
- A non-authenticated user will be able to view the landing page, the list of garages, and the individual page of a garage which contains some information about the garage.
- Only a logged in, authenticated user will be able to view or schedule their appointments with garages, mark a garage as their favorite, and view their user profile. 
- In addition, an authenticated user will be able to edit a few fields about their account information including their name, email, description, and vehicle description.
- If a user account is listed as owning a garage, they will also have access to the garage management page: A page which loads information about the garage's monthly earnings, number of appointments, information about all appointments scheduled with that garage, and a few other details.
